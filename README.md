### Abstract

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production beyond standard block rewards, by reordering, including, or excluding transactions in a block. This study analyzes Ethereum transactions from January 2024, revealing systematic favoritism-oriented behaviors in transaction ordering. The findings suggest an emerging parallel economy that potentially undermines blockchain’s democratic principles, highlighting the need for governance mechanisms to preserve decentralization and user fairness.
